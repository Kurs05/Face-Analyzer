# Face-Analyzer using Dlib and DeepFace

This project detects human emotions from facial expressions using DeepFace, draws facial landmarks on the image using the dlib library, and stores the results in a local SQLite database. Note that the analysis results may contain inaccuracies, as no AI system is perfect.
